# NER

Here are some different approaches to implement NER task including using CRF++ toolkit which is implemented in C++ and python package called crfsuite, plus one simple code run on the colab
implemented with BERT. A more well-furnished and native BERT implementation in my repos can be found here[Transformers-Bert](https://github.com/Konic-NLP/Transformers-NER), and the BI-LSTM-CRF implemented with Tensorflow can be found here[BI-LSTM-for NER](https://github.com/Konic-NLP/BI-LSTM-for-NER)
